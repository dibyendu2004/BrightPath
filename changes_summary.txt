# brightPath Project Changes Summary

## Backend Implementation (Node.js/Express)
1.  **Server Initialization**: Created `server` directory, initialized npm, and installed core dependencies (express, mongoose, dotenv, cors, clerk, svix, cloudinary, multer).
2.  **Project Structure**: Setup standard folder structure: `config`, `controllers`, `models`, `routes`, `middlewares`.
3.  **Database Connection**: Configured MongoDB connection in `server/config/mongodb.js` to use the database name **`BrightPath`**.
4.  **Models (Mongoose)**:
    -   `User`: Syncs with Clerk, stores enrolled courses.
    -   `Course`: Comprehensive schema for course content, pricing, and ratings.
    -   `Purchase`: Tracks enrollment transactions.
    -   `CourseProgress`: Tracks student progress through lectures.
5.  **Controllers & Routes**:
    -   **Webhooks**: Synchronizes Clerk user creation, updates, and deletions with the local database.
    -   **User**: Handles data fetching, course purchasing, and progress updates.
    -   **Course**: Public APIs for browsing and searching courses.
    -   **Educator**: APIs for course creation (including image upload), dashboard statistics, and student management.
6.  **Middleware**:
    -   `authMiddleware.js`: Protects routes using user IDs passed in headers (integrated with Clerk).
    -   `multer.js`: Handles multipart/form-data for file uploads.
7.  **Server Config**: Integrated all routes and middleware in `server/server.js` with Cloudinary support for thumbnails.

## Frontend Integration (React/Vite)
1.  **API Integration**:
    -   Installed `axios` for HTTP requests and `react-toastify` for notifications.
    -   Updated `AppContext.jsx` to handle backend communication fetching:
        -   Global courses list.
        -   User profile data.
        -   User enrollment list.
2.  **Global UI Updates**:
    -   Added `ToastContainer` to `main.jsx` for platform-wide alerts.
    -   Updated `AppContext` to provide `backendUrl` and `userData`.
3.  **Educator Dashboard**:
    -   `AddCourse.jsx`: Revamped to submit real form data, handle dynamic chapters/lectures, and upload course thumbnails to Cloudinary.
    -   `Dashboard.jsx`: Updated to display real educator stats (earnings, enrollments, latest students).
    -   `MyCourses.jsx`: Updated to fetch and display the educator's specific course list from the database.
4.  **Student Experience**:
    -   `CourseDetails.jsx`: Updated to fetch real course data via API and handle the enrollment flow.
    -   *(In Progress)*: Updating `MyEnrollment.jsx` and `Player.jsx` for real progress tracking.

## Technical Improvements
- Switched from static mock data (`dummyCourses`) to dynamic API-driven data.
- Implemented file upload capability for course thumbnails.
- Added comprehensive error/success notifications using Toastify.
- Standardized API endpoints following RESTful principles.
